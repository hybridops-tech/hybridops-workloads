# HybridOps.Core - Execution Architecture (Anti-drift Note v1.1)

This document is the authoritative anti-drift reference for HybridOps.Core execution architecture (v1.1).
If an implementation change conflicts with this note, treat it as drift and reconcile before proceeding.

## Scope

- Applies to: hyops CLI, runtime layout, module resolution, driver execution, evidence/redaction, pack resolution, validators.
- Non-goals: retention policy, cloud/provider permissions design, detailed Terraform/Terragrunt module authoring practices.

## 1. Core concepts

HybridOps.Core uses four concepts to keep execution deterministic, replaceable, and tarball-safe:

1) Module - declarative intent contract (what)
2) Driver - execution engine (how)
3) Profile - policy and defaults (how, consistently)
4) Pack - tool plan/bundle executed by the driver (what to run)

### Norms

- Module contracts are stable and tool-agnostic.
- Drivers and packs may evolve independently without breaking module contracts.
- Profiles carry opinionated policy; packs must not.

## 2. References and identifiers

### 2.1 Timeless module_refs

- module_ref MUST be stable and MUST NOT encode time/cohort labels (e.g., no 2026E).
- Recommended top-level namespaces:
  - org/ - org/tenancy primitives
  - core/ - foundation primitives (networking, routing, baseline infra)
  - platform/ - platform services (NetBox, PostgreSQL, registries, secrets services)
  - examples/ - demos/smoke tests (non-product)

### 2.2 Dot notation (operator convenience)

- The CLI MAY accept dot notation for convenience (e.g., core.hetzner.edge-network).
- The runtime MUST normalize identifiers to a canonical internal form.
- Canonical form (v1.1): slash-separated (core/hetzner/edge-network).

### 2.3 Filesystem-safe identifiers

- Evidence paths use a filesystem-safe module_id derived from module_ref:
  - module_id = module_ref.replace("/", "__")

## 3. Module contract (intent)

A module is declarative data describing intent, required credentials, and verification.

### 3.1 Required fields

A module MUST define:
- module_ref
- inputs.defaults (may be empty mapping)
- requirements.credentials (identifiers only; no secret values)
- execution.driver
- execution.profile
- execution.pack_ref.id

### 3.2 Recommended fields

A module SHOULD define:
- outputs.publish (what to expose from normalized outputs)
- constraints (semantic constraints not representable purely by type)
- probes (verification steps/identifiers, where applicable)

### 3.3 Forbidden content (must not leak implementation)

A module MUST NOT embed tool implementation details, including:
- Terraform/Terragrunt/Packer/Ansible sources or repo paths
- backend/state/workspace wiring
- CLI flags or tool invocation parameters
- secrets or secret material
- toolchain version pinning (belongs to profile/driver)
- hooks/policy logic (belongs to profile/driver)

## 4. Profiles (policy + defaults)

A profile is a versioned policy bundle interpreted by a driver.

Profiles SHOULD govern:
- runner model (local/remote)
- backend/state selection and workspace naming
- toolchain policy (allowed/pinned versions)
- templates/hooks that are driver-owned (generated into the run workdir)
- logging and redaction defaults
- retry/timeouts and safety flags

Profiles MUST NOT redefine module intent. Profiles may provide defaults only where consistent policy is required.

## 5. Packs (tool plan bundles)

A pack is a tool-specific plan bundle executed by a driver (e.g., a Terragrunt stack tree).

### Norms

- Packs MUST be immutable inputs to a run (drivers copy packs into an isolated workdir).
- Packs MUST be tarball-safe and MUST NOT assume repo layout or .git.
- Packs MUST NOT own backend/workspace naming rules (belongs to driver/profile).
- Runtime-injected configuration must be provided via environment variables or generated files owned by driver/profile.

## 6. Runtime root and packaging (tarball-safe)

### 6.1 Runtime root precedence

Any command that writes runtime artifacts MUST resolve runtime root using:

1) --root <path>
2) $HYOPS_RUNTIME_ROOT
3) ~/.hybridops

### Norms

- Commands MUST NOT infer a repo root for runtime outputs.
- Packaged assets must be located relative to the installed package (release root), not Git.

### 6.2 Runtime layout (minimum)

Commands MUST create layout if missing:

- <root>/config/
- <root>/credentials/
- <root>/vault/
- <root>/meta/
- <root>/logs/
- <root>/state/
- <root>/work/

## 7. Evidence, redaction, readiness, stamps

### 7.1 Evidence paths (stable)

Evidence MUST be written under the runtime root:

- Init:   <root>/logs/init/<target>/<run_id>/
- Module: <root>/logs/module/<module_id>/<run_id>/

If --out-dir is supported, it is an override root only; structure remains stable:

- Init (override):   <out_dir>/init/<target>/<run_id>/
- Module (override): <out_dir>/module/<module_id>/<run_id>/

### 7.2 Driver evidence placement (v1.1)

Driver evidence is written inside the module command evidence directory (e.g., apply run evidence).
A separate <root>/logs/driver/<driver_id>/<run_id>/ tree is a future enhancement (not v1.1 behavior).

### 7.3 Redaction

- Evidence MUST NOT contain secrets.
- Subprocess stdout/stderr captures MUST be redacted prior to persistence.
- Redaction patterns may evolve without a version bump.

### 7.4 Readiness markers

- <root>/meta/<target>.ready.json

Readiness markers MUST reflect truth and should only be written when the target is actually ready.

### 7.5 Runtime stamp (best-effort)

- <root>/meta/runtime.json
- Non-secret
- MUST NOT block execution if stamping fails

## 8. Workdir isolation (v1.1)

Drivers MUST execute in an isolated workdir under runtime root:

<root>/work/<module_id>/<run_id>/stack/

- Packs are copied into the workdir (packs remain immutable).
- Inputs are materialized as driver-owned generated files in the workdir.

## 9. Pack resolution (v1.1)

### 9.1 Mapping rule

Pack stack directory resolves as:

<packs_root>/<driver_ref>/<pack_id>/stack/

Where:
- packs_root precedence:
  1) $HYOPS_PACKS_ROOT if set (points to directory containing packs/)
  2) release root fallback: <release_root>/packs
- driver_ref comes from execution.driver (e.g., iac/terragrunt)
- pack_id comes from execution.pack_ref.id

Example:
- driver_ref: iac/terragrunt
- pack_id: gcp/org/00-project-factory@v1.0

Resolves to:

packs/iac/terragrunt/gcp/org/00-project-factory@v1.0/stack

## 10. Inputs precedence (v1.1)

Inputs are resolved in this precedence order (highest wins):

1) HYOPS_INPUTS_JSON (JSON object; merges into inputs)
2) HYOPS_INPUT_<key> / HYOPS_INPUT_<path__to__key> (env overrides; supports nested keys via __)
3) --inputs <file.yml> (operator inputs file)
4) spec.inputs.defaults

Notes:
- HYOPS_INPUT_* values are JSON-decoded when possible (e.g., true, 3, {"a":1}).
- Nested override example: HYOPS_INPUT_network__cidr='"10.10.0.0/24"'.

## 11. Validators (module input validation)

### 11.1 Responsibility

- Validators enforce module-specific schema/constraints after inputs merge and before driver execution.
- Validators are keyed by canonical module_ref.

Validation MUST NOT live in:
- profiles (policy bundles)
- packs (implementation bundles)

Rationale:
- Validation defines the module contract and must travel with the module capability, not with policy or implementation.

### 11.2 Registry model (plugin-ready)

- A runtime registry maps module_ref -> validator callable.
- Built-in validators are registered from a single built-in registration module.
- A future plugin system may load third-party validators via Python entry points; this must not change module contracts.

## 12. Driver loading model (plugin-ready)

- Core provides a driver registry (ref -> callable).
- Built-in drivers are registered from a single built-in registration module (importable from installed package).
- Plugin discovery may load third-party drivers via Python entry points.
- Plugin loading MUST NOT change the module contract.

## 13. Operator command expectations (v1.1)

### 13.1 hyops apply produces evidence + deterministic outputs

hyops apply must:
- resolve runtime root + ensure layout
- resolve module spec + merge inputs + validate inputs
- resolve pack + copy into isolated workdir
- generate driver-owned input files (e.g., inputs.auto.tfvars.json)
- run tool steps (driver-specific)
- write evidence envelopes for tool steps
- write deterministic driver meta + result payloads

Minimum evidence artifacts (names are normative for v1.1):
- driver_meta.json
- driver_result.json
- tool step evidence envelopes (e.g., terragrunt_init.*, terragrunt_apply.*, terragrunt_output.*)

## 14. Anti-drift checks (quick tests)

- Running from a tarball without .git works.
- Defaults write to ~/.hybridops; --root overrides; HYOPS_RUNTIME_ROOT overrides.
- Pack resolution does not depend on repo root; uses HYOPS_PACKS_ROOT or release root fallback.
- Evidence paths match the stable structure; --out-dir preserves structure.
- Evidence contains no secrets; subprocess stdout/stderr are redacted.
- Module specs remain tool-agnostic (no backend/workspace/version glue).
- Drivers can add new packs without changing module specs.
- hyops apply produces:
  - driver_meta.json, driver_result.json
  - inputs.auto.tfvars.json in the workdir stack
  - tool step evidence envelopes

## 15. Design guidance (non-normative)

### 15.1 Generic infra + blueprint

- Avoid shipping instance-specific machines as first-class modules (e.g., ctrl-01).
- Prefer:
  - generic building-block modules (compute, network, storage)
  - higher-level capability modules (blueprints) that define what makes a role (hardening, Jenkins, GitOps, guardrails)

This keeps packs composable and prevents product shape from becoming tied to one environment layout.
