# DocsGPT deployment guidance
# - Keep it stateless in Kubernetes.
# - Externalize ALL persistence (DB/vector index) outside the cluster (VM/LXC/managed).
# - Provide secrets via an existing Secret created by a module/blueprint (do not commit secrets here).
# - Configure strict CORS to allow only your docs site origin.
#
# You must align the values below to the Helm chart you choose.
# Recommended if you don't have an official DocsGPT chart: use a generic "app template" chart.
